* Data Analysis: Utilized structured SQL queries to analyze sales trends, uncover patterns, and generate insights

## 2. Power BI Integration
* Data Visualization: Connected Power BI to the MySQL database to create dynamic dashboards and reports.
* Interactive Reports: Designed interactive visualizations to explore sales data, track KPIs, and identify trends.
* Performance Tracking: Developed reports to monitor total revenue, sales performance by product, and other critical metrics.

## 3. Data Analysis
Once the data is prepared, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis. This may include:

* Identifying top-selling pizza flavors.
* Analyzing sales trends over time.
* Evaluating customer demographics and preferences.
* Calculating average order values.
* Assessing the performance of individual restaurant locations.

## 4. Power BI Visualization
Power BI is used to create interactive and informative visualizations that showcase the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations may include:
